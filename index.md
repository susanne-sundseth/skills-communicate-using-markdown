# Header 1

Use one hashtag (or octothorp) to indicate an H1.

## Header 2 

Use two hashtags to indicate an H2. To add additional levels, use the corresponding number of hashtags to indicate the header level, up to level 6.

### Adding an image

Be sure to include description of the image in square brackets. The descriptive text is used by screen readers and when the image doesn't display such as when there is a poor connection.

### Adding a code block

Use three backticks at the beginning and end of code text to create a code block. Whatever content is included on the same line as the backticks does not display (see example 2). Code blocks can render differently, depending on the language.

**Example 1**
```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```

**Example 2**
``` javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
```
### Making a task list
A task list has checkboxes to check off. Ensure that you observe the spacing or the list will not render correctly. When you press Enter, the next line will automatically format as the lext list item.

- [ ] Let the dogs out.
- [ ] Go outside and tell them to stop barking.
- [ ] Go back inside and wait for them to come inside.
- [ ] Give them a treat and tell them that they are good dogs.
